- name: ISO27001 Compliance Automation
  descr: As part of work to achieve a ISO27001 compliance, I created a GitOps automated system that allowed for auditing change management of applications as well as Infrastructure, this was to cover the various controls laid out by the standard. Alongside this I helped draft the policies that are required to meet the standards which covered various security concerns of the company. I also worked with the auditor to prove our compliance with the standard
